	NOTES FOR USERS:


	1. Each user can change the content of the test in the SimpleDimple.php source and customize it for themselves.

	2. Don't forget that example.php stores examples of how to run tests, so you don't have to go and read the source.

	3. In general, my task was to simplify the phpUnit framework. Whether I succeeded or not, you be the judge.
